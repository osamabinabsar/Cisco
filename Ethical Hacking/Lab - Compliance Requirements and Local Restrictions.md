### Reflection
Do companies in your country need to follow compliance frameworks that are imposed by other countries? If so, what are the consequences for failing to meet the requirements of the frameworks and what are the penalties if there is a data breach?

Yes the companies that are in my scope of research all of them has to follow the local regulations. For example some of these companies operates in the European Union, Middle East, USA. Some of these companies are the primary service provider in some parts of the world like UAE. Therefore they has to hello compliance frameworks imposed by the countries. Failing to do so will cause them hefty fines.
